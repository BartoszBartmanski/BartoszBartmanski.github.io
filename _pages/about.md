## About

I am a scientific programmer at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ([EMBL](https://www.embl.de/)) in the [Zimmermann lab](https://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/zimmermann/). Prior to EMBL, I was working on my DPhil at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) on "Efficient methods for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion models on evolving domains" under the supervision of [Prof. Ruth Baker](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ruth.baker).
