## About

I am a research software engineer at Julio Saez-Rodriguez's group at the Joint Research  Center for Computational biomedicine. Prior to this, I was a scientific programmer at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ([EMBL](https://www.embl.de/)) in the [Zimmermann lab](https://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/zimmermann/). My PhD was at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) on "Efficient methods for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion models on evolving domains" under the supervision of [Prof. Ruth Baker](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ruth.baker).  

My previous work has mostly focused on developing software for simulation and analysis of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems on evolving domains. More recently, I have focused on using machine learning approaches to predict and analyse mass spectrometry data. Overall, I am interested in developing and applying mathematical and computational tools to provide insight of phenomena in different disciplines.

I am also passionate in promoting good software development practices such as:
* unit-testing
* continuous integration
* clear and extensive documentation
