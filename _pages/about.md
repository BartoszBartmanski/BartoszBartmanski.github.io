## About

I am a scientific programmer at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). Prior to EMBL, I was working on my DPhil at University of Oxford on "Efficient methods for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion models on evolving domains" under the supervision of Prof. [Ruth Baker](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ruth.baker).
