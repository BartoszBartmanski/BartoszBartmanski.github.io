## About

I am a bioinformatician at Maria Zimmermann-Kogadeeva's group at European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Heidelberg. Previously, I was a research
software engineer at Julio Saez-Rodriguez's group at the Joint Research Center
for Computational biomedicine, while my PhD was at the [Mathematical
Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of
Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) on "Efficient methods for simulating stochastic
reaction-diffusion models on evolving domains" under the supervision of [Prof.
Ruth Baker](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ruth.baker).

My previous work has mostly focused on developing software for simulation and
analysis of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems on evolving domains. More
recently, I have focused on using machine learning approaches to predict and
analyse mass spectrometry data. Overall, I am interested in developing and
applying mathematical and computational tools to provide insight of phenomena
in different disciplines.

I am also passionate in promoting good software development practices such as:
* unit-testing
* continuous integration
* clear and extensive documentation
