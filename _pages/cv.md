## Education

* PhD in Systems Biology, University of Oxford, 2020
    * Thesis title: Efficient methods for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion models on evolving domains
    * Supervisor: Prof. Ruth Baker
    * Implemented and analysed different stochastic models of reaction-diffusion systems
    * Developed open-source packages for stochastic simulations and generation of non-uniform meshes
    * Communicated thesis findings in both oral presentations at international conferences and in scientific publications

* Masters degree in Mathematics, Durham University, 2015
    * Thesis title: Mathematical modelling of musical instruments - piano string
    * Supervisor: Dr. Bernard Piette
    * Applied theory of elasticity to model musical instruments
