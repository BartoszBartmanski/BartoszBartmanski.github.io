* [DualMesh](https://github.com/BartoszBartmanski/DualMesh)
    - Python module for generating dual meshes.

* [StoSpa](https://github.com/BartoszBartmanski/StoSpa)
    - A C++ package for running stochastic simulations to generate sample paths for reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME). Reactions happen within a compartment, and the collection of compartments makes up the domain of the system. Diffusion of molecules is modelled as jumps between adjacent voxels.

* [StoSpa2](https://github.com/BartoszBartmanski/StoSpa2)
    - A C++ software package for stochastic simulations of spatially extended systems. Code-base has been completely refactored since the previous version of StoSpa. Python bindings have also been included.
    - Documentation available [here](https://stospa2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
